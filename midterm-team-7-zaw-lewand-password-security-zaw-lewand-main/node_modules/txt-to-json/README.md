# txt-to-json

txt-to-json is a simple script that converts txt files to JSON and outputs them in the core working directory. txt-to-json allows for full customization, letting you insert your own filter functions to determine keys and values.

# Installation

Install via npm: `npm install txt-to-json`

# Usage

```js
const txtToJson = require('txt-to-json')

txtToJson('./data.txt')
```

**Example input**

```txt
key1:value1
key2:value2
```

**Example output**

```json
{"key1":"value1","key2":"value2"}
```

# Using line and key filters

If your keys are split by commas, and values by hyphens, use:

```js
txtToJson('./data.txt', function (doc) {
    return doc.split(',')
}, function (line) {
    const [key, value] = line.split('-')
    return [key, value]
})
```
